<h1># DCGAN</h1>

This repository focuses on training a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on a dataset of butterfly images. <br>
The goal is to generate realistic butterfly images. Additionally, differentiable augmentations were applied during <br>                                                                      
training to improve the model's performance. The quality of the generated images was evaluated using the  <br>                                                                          
Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric.<br>
<b>Dataset</b> <br>
The dataset consists of high-quality butterfly images. The images were preprocessed to ensure consistency in size and format. <br>
the dataset was taken from kaggle and can be found <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification/data">here</a><br>
