<h1># DCGAN</h1>
<pre>
  This repository focuses on training a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on a dataset of butterfly images. 
  The goal is to generate realistic butterfly images. Additionally, differentiable augmentations were applied during training to improve the model's performance.\
  The quality of the generated images was evaluated using the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric.

 <b>Dataset</b> 
The dataset consists of high-quality butterfly images. The images were preprocessed to ensure consistency in size and format. 
the dataset was taken from kaggle and can be found <a src = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification/data">here</a>
